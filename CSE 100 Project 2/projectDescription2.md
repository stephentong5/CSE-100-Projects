# Overview
The mathematical concept of a "graph" is fundamental to Computer Science. In general, any network of connected individuals can be represented using a graph. Almost all of the data structures covered in this course are either themselves graphs or can be abstractly represented using a graph.

For example, in the realm of HIV and COVID-19 epidemiology, the current gold-standard method for analyzing viral sequence data to study the spread of the virus is to perform transmission clustering using a tool called HIV-TRACE (Pond et al., 2018). If you are given n viral sequences (one collected per patient), HIV-TRACE essentially does the following:

Construct an empty graph with n nodes (one per sequence)

Compute the distance between each pair of sequences (u,v) under the TN93 model of DNA evolution (Tamura & Nei, 1993)

If the pairwise distance between u and v is less than or equal to a given threshold (HIV-TRACE uses 0.015 by default), connect u and v with an undirected edge

Each of the connected components of the resulting graph define a "transmission cluster"

In addition to finding transmission clusters, the graph produced by HIV-TRACE can yield other information relevant for the prevention of the spread of a virus (Grabowski et al., 2018)

In this Project, we have provided an API of a Graph class that you need to implement. This class will be used to represent undirected graphs. In the starter code, we have provided 4 code files (Graph.h, Graph.cpp, GraphTest.cpp, and Makefile) as well as 2 example graph files (small.csv and hiv.csv).

## Graph.h
This file contains the basic declarations of the (undirected) Graph class that you need to implement. We have declared a series of function signatures that you will need to implement. You are free to modify Graph.h however you wish (e.g. adding instance variables to the Graph class, adding any helper functions you'd like, etc.). Our only requirement is that the function signatures we have declared remain unchanged (though you are welcome to overload them if you wish).

Please be sure to thoroughly read the header comments in Graph.h to be sure you understand the functionality, input(s), and output(s) of each function in the Graph class.

## Graph.cpp
This file contains the skeleton of implementing the functions we have declared in the (undirected) Graph class. Your task is to fill in the function bodies. You are welcome to add any variables, functions, classes, etc. you wish.

## GraphTest.cpp
This file contains a tester program to help you run and test your code. We will be using this program to grade your code. You are welcome to modify GraphTest.cpp for testing purposes however you wish: we will simply ignore any changes you have made to GraphTest.cpp when we grade your code. The GraphTest executable that is created from GraphTest.cpp can be run as follows:

`./GraphTest <edgelist_csv> <test>`
### Edge List
The <edgelist_csv> argument is the filename of an edge list representing an undirected graph with non-negative edge weights in the CSV format: each line represents an undirected edge between nodes u and v with weight w in the following format: u,v,w

For example, imagine we want to represent the following graph:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8de4832-6310-465d-a2d1-079f8cbe94b3) <br>
We could represent it using the following edge list CSV (note that the order of the rows is arbitrary):

A,B,0.1 <br>
A,C,0.5 <br>
B,C,0.1 <br>
B,D,0.1 <br>
E,F,0.4 <br>
F,G,0.5 <br>
In the example folder of the starter code, we have provided 2 example edge list CSV files: small.csv, which is the exact graph shown above, and hiv.csv, which is a small example graph produced from an HIV-TRACE analysis of a real HIV dataset from San Diego (Little et al., 2014).

Here are some things you can expect about the edge list CSVs you will be given:

You are guaranteed that edge weights will be non-negative (i.e., they will be â‰¥0)

You are guaranteed there will not be any self-edges (e.g. u,u,?)

You are guaranteed that you will not be given a multigraph, meaning you are guaranteed that there will not exist multiple edges between nodes u and v in the provided edge list

Further, because the edges are undirected, if you see an edge from u to v (e.g. u,v,?), you are guaranteed that you will not see an edge from v to u (e.g. v,u,?) later in the file

Remember: an edge from u to v is bidirectional and is thus also an edge from v to u

You are guaranteed that there will be at least 1 edge in the graph

You are not guaranteed that the edges in the CSV will be sorted in any particular order

### Test
The <test> argument denotes which of the GraphTest tests you want to run. The tests are as follows:

graph_properties: Test building a Graph object and checking its basic properties

shortest_unweighted: Test the Graph::shortest_path_unweighted function

shortest_weighted: Test the Graph::shortest_path_weighted function

connected_components: Test the Graph::connected_components function

smallest_threshold: Test the Graph::smallest_connecting_threshold function

Feel free to investigate the code within GraphTest.cpp to see how exactly it works.

## Makefile
This file will help you compile your code using the make command. If you choose to create any additional code files, you are welcome to do so: our only requirement is that, given the original version of GraphTest.cpp, we should be able to run your code using the make command, which should create an executable called GraphTest that can be run as described above.
